# DroneSimulation
This is a basic simulation I wrote in Python as a development aid for the prototype flight-control solution used to fly the Crazyflie drone.
This program simulates a basic flight, including takeoff and hover, rotate to desired orientation, traverse and climb to orientation, hover, return to origin and land.
